# Five Stars - Maintain & Manage Your Online Reviews
_Five Stars_ is a simple PHP app that aims to keep your company ratings as close to five stars as possible on 3rd party review sites.

1. Send your customers a link to _Five Stars_ and ask them to review their experience.
2. Customers rating you low will be asked for further details so that you can rectify the issue before they write a review.
3. Customers rating you highly are asked to leave a review on a 3rd party review site that either has the fewest reviews or the lowest star rating for your company.
4. As a result, you get a chance to turnaround angry customers before they vent online, whilst also using your happy customers to fix any less than perfect review site ratings.
